# Movie Showtime API

The Movie Showtime API is a RESTful web service that allows you check out the movie you would want to see or is showing on your prefered Zambian cinemas. This API is based on the data scraped from [mydorpie.com](), a mobile-friendly search platform for Southern Africa that hosts the region's busiest independent movie guide with trailers, load-shedding schedules, weather and more.

You can use this API to:

- Check for malls that have cinemas
- Get information about cinema in a mall, such as name, address, phone number.
- Get information about movies in a cinema, such as title, rating, runtime, and showtimes
- Get additional information about the movie such as genre, duration, stars, directors, release date
